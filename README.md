# Preprocessing for I3D

This repository contains a script file to preprocess the data for deepmind's kinetics i3d network because the original repository [I3D Deepmind](https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d) does not contain a detailed description for preprocessing the data.

**Note: Optical flow is caluclated by cpu and not by gpu -> therefore it is very slow. However, you can simple change it by using a gpu based optical flow calculation**
